# Banking-Management-System
This project presents the implementation and working of a complex and efficient management system of a bank using 
advanced data structures along with advanced queue management. The management system also supports secure permanent 
storage of data. The implementation is done on C++ but can be extended to any other language. This project also 
presents the Graphical User Interface implementation of the project using SFML as graphics library, but this GUI is yet to be 
joined with the actual back end workings.
